# DistributedGNN

## Introduction
DistrGNN is a research project supported by a scholarship from the University of Pisa. It focuses on investigating and implementing pipeline parallelism in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The study case is based on the methodology outlined in the paper **[Vision GNN: An Image is Worth Graph of Nodes](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/3743e69c8e47eb2e6d3afaea80e439fb-Paper-Conference.pdf)** by Han et al. (2022), presented at *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)*. The project explores the efficient distribution of GNN computations across multiple computing nodes, with a particular emphasis on pipeline parallelism. Additionally, it examines the combination of **pipeline parallelism** and **data parallelism** to optimize performance and scalability in large-scale GNN training tasks.

More details on this study, including technical insights and experimental results, are available in the project's report **report.pdf**.
